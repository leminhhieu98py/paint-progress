# Supabase

Migrations are applied to the hosted project with `npx supabase db push`.
Local `supabase start` needs Docker and is not required for this project.

## One-time dashboard setup

See spec §12. In short:

1. Authentication → Providers → Email: disable **Allow new users to sign up**.
2. Create the bootstrap admin `linhdeptrai123@app.local`, then insert its
   `profiles` row with `username = 'linhdeptrai123'`, `role = 'admin'`.
3. Storage: create the private bucket `drawings`.
4. Edge Functions → `admin-users` → Secrets: `CRED_ENC_KEY`.
   `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is injected by the platform as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

Never commit any of these values.
